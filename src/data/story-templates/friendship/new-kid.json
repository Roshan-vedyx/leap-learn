  "simple": "Sam spotted a new student sitting completely alone at lunch, looking nervous and sad about being in a totally unfamiliar place. The new kid seemed overwhelmed by all the noise and unfamiliar faces everywhere. [CHOICE POINT 1] How should Sam help this new student feel more welcome? A) Walk over and introduce yourself, then invite them to sit with your friends, B) Ask your friends to come over together so the new kid meets everyone at once, or C) Sit nearby first to make sure they're okay with company before approaching. [CONSEQUENCE 1A] Sam walked over with a friendly smile and said 'Hi, I'm Sam. Want to join us?' and Alex gratefully accepted the invitation. [CONSEQUENCE 1B] When Sam's whole friend group approached together, Alex felt a bit overwhelmed but appreciated everyone's enthusiasm to include them. [CONSEQUENCE 1C] Sitting nearby first helped Sam notice that Alex seemed ready for company, making the introduction feel more natural. Alex smiled huge and said 'Yes please! I'm Alex and I'm so relieved someone talked to me!' They shared lunch and discovered they both loved basketball, video games, and funny movies. [CHOICE POINT 2] How can Sam help Alex feel truly connected to the school community? A) Invite Alex to hang out after school and on weekends to build stronger friendship, B) Introduce Alex to different friend groups so they can find their perfect social fit, or C) Help Alex discover clubs or activities where they can meet people with similar interests. [PERSONAL REFLECTION] Have you ever been the new person somewhere? How did it feel when someone reached out to include you? [ACTION REFLECTION] How could you notice and help new people feel welcome in your school or community?",
    "regular": "Sam noticed a solitary new student sitting nervously in the bustling cafeteria, clearly feeling overwhelmed by the chaotic environment and sea of unfamiliar faces during their first week at school. The newcomer's body language suggested they were struggling with the challenging transition that transferring schools represents for most students. [CHOICE POINT 1] Helping someone navigate this difficult social situation would require thoughtful and sensitive approaches. A) Approach directly with genuine warmth to introduce yourself and offer immediate inclusion in your established friend group, B) Coordinate with your friends to make a group introduction that shows the new student they're welcomed by multiple people, or C) Position yourself nearby to gauge their comfort level and readiness for social interaction before making direct contact. [CONSEQUENCE 1A] Direct friendly approach worked perfectly as Sam's genuine warmth immediately put Alex at ease, leading to natural conversation and grateful acceptance of the lunch invitation. [CONSEQUENCE 1B] Group introduction created initial overwhelm, but Alex appreciated seeing that multiple students cared about including newcomers in their social circles. [CONSEQUENCE 1C] Reading social cues first helped Sam time the introduction perfectly when Alex seemed most receptive to making new connections. Through sharing lunch conversations and discovering mutual interests in basketball, gaming, and entertainment, Alex began feeling genuinely comfortable in their new school environment. [CHOICE POINT 2] Having established initial connection, what's the best way to help Alex develop lasting friendships and school belonging? A) Extend friendship beyond school hours through weekend activities and ongoing social connections that build deeper relationships, B) Facilitate introductions to diverse friend groups so Alex can discover where they fit best socially and academically, or C) Connect Alex with extracurricular activities, sports teams, or clubs where they can meet like-minded peers and develop new interests. [PERSONAL REFLECTION] Think about times when you've felt like an outsider - what actions from others made the biggest difference in helping you feel accepted and included? [ACTION REFLECTION] How can you develop better awareness of students who might be feeling isolated and create more inclusive social environments in your daily interactions?",
    
    "challenge": "Sam observed a clearly distressed new student experiencing the profound social isolation and cultural adjustment challenges that characterize difficult school transitions, particularly when moving during mid-academic years without established peer networks. The newcomer's visible anxiety and withdrawn behavior indicated they were struggling with the overwhelming social dynamics and institutional navigation that most students take for granted. [CHOICE POINT 1] Facilitating meaningful social integration for struggling new students requires sophisticated interpersonal skills and culturally sensitive approaches. A) Initiate authentic personal connection through genuine conversation, empathetic listening, and immediate inclusion in established social networks while respecting individual comfort levels and social preferences, B) Mobilize collaborative peer support by coordinating group introductions that demonstrate community-wide welcome while avoiding overwhelming social pressure or forced interactions, or C) Practice strategic social assessment by observing behavioral cues, communication patterns, and comfort levels to time interventions appropriately and respect individual autonomy in social engagement. [CONSEQUENCE 1A] Authentic personal outreach created immediate relief for Alex's social anxiety as Sam's genuine empathy and inclusive leadership provided the emotional safety needed for vulnerable relationship formation. [CONSEQUENCE 1B] Coordinated group welcome efforts demonstrated community values around inclusion while requiring careful management to avoid overwhelming Alex during their vulnerable adjustment period. [CONSEQUENCE 1C] Thoughtful social assessment enabled Sam to approach Alex when they seemed most emotionally prepared for connection, resulting in natural relationship development and mutual comfort. Through sustained investment in authentic friendship building, they discovered profound compatibility in athletic interests, technological hobbies, and entertainment preferences that created lasting bonds beyond surface-level social inclusion. [CHOICE POINT 2] Having established foundational friendship, what's the most effective approach to supporting Alex's long-term social integration and academic success? A) Develop comprehensive friendship networks through extended social activities, family involvement, and ongoing emotional support that creates genuine belonging rather than superficial inclusion, B) Facilitate strategic introductions across diverse peer groups, academic partnerships, and social circles that help Alex identify their optimal community connections and personal identity expression, or C) Connect Alex with structured extracurricular opportunities, leadership development programs, and interest-based communities that provide multiple pathways for social engagement and personal growth. [PERSONAL REFLECTION] How do your own experiences with feeling excluded or welcomed influence your capacity for empathy and your commitment to creating inclusive environments for others? [ACTION REFLECTION] What systematic approaches could you develop to identify and support students experiencing social isolation while building more welcoming and inclusive school communities for everyone?"
