    "simple": "Aryaan dipped below the waves, bubbles tickling his cheeks as he swam deeper. Colors shimmered all around him—orange, pink, purple coral like a glowing rainbow city. Tiny fish brushed past his arms like slippery butterflies. The coral felt rough and bumpy when he touched it gently.\n\n[CHOICE POINT 1] What should Aryaan explore first?  \nA) Swim closer to the bright orange coral  \nB) Follow the school of shiny silver fish  \nC) Look under the big coral arch  \n\n[CONSEQUENCE A] Aryaan chose to swim closer to the orange coral. Up close, he noticed some coral had faded patches of white. His stomach tightened—something wasn’t right.  \n[CONSEQUENCE B] Aryaan chose to follow the silver fish. They darted quickly, then suddenly turned back. Aryaan realized they avoided a patch of white, sick coral.  \n[CONSEQUENCE C] Aryaan chose to look under the arch. It was cool and shadowy, but some coral branches there had turned pale. The reef didn’t feel so healthy.  \n\n[STORY CONTINUATION] Aryaan’s chest thumped faster. The coral garden wasn’t all colorful—parts of it were hurting. Warm water was making the coral sick.  \n\n[PERSONAL REFLECTION] Have you ever seen something you love start to fade or break? How did it make you feel?  \n\nAryaan swam back up, splashing onto the shore. His wet feet left sandy prints as he ran to tell everyone about the coral.  \n\n[CHOICE POINT 2] What should Aryaan do to help the coral?  \nA) Ask people to stop throwing trash in the water  \nB) Teach friends how to snorkel gently  \nC) Tell stories about the rainbow reef to inspire others  \n\n[CONSEQUENCE A] Aryaan asked everyone to keep the ocean clean. People nodded and promised to try harder.  \n[CONSEQUENCE B] Aryaan showed his friends how to snorkel without stepping on coral. They laughed and learned.  \n[CONSEQUENCE C] Aryaan told magical stories about the rainbow reef. Listeners clapped and wanted to protect it.  \n\n[STORY CONTINUATION] No matter which way, Aryaan’s words helped others care for the reef.  \n\n[FINAL CONCLUSION] The coral garden wasn’t just beautiful—it needed friends. Aryaan felt proud to be one.  \n\n[ACTION REFLECTION] What’s one way YOU could help the ocean near your home?",
    "regular": "Aryaan descended into the underwater coral garden. Light shimmered through the surface like golden ribbons. He kicked his fins slowly, brushing past curious parrotfish. The coral stretched in every shape—branching like trees, glowing like lanterns, ridged like stone. When Aryaan ran his fingers across the surface, it felt rough, alive with tiny moving creatures.\n\n[CHOICE POINT 1] What should Aryaan focus on first?  \nA) Watch the clownfish darting in and out of anemones  \nB) Sketch the coral shapes in his waterproof notebook  \nC) Listen closely to the crackling sounds of the reef  \n\n[CONSEQUENCE A] Aryaan followed the clownfish. But then he noticed—some of their coral homes were pale and empty. His heart sank.  \n[CONSEQUENCE B] Aryaan began sketching. As he looked carefully, he realized some corals were missing color, leaving blank patches on his page.  \n[CONSEQUENCE C] Aryaan closed his eyes and listened. The usual busy crackles were quieter near a patch of white coral—like the reef’s voice was fading.  \n\n[STORY CONTINUATION] Aryaan realized he was witnessing coral bleaching. Warmer water was stressing the delicate coral animals.  \n\n[PERSONAL REFLECTION] Have you ever felt worried when something in nature looked different or weaker than before? What did you do?  \n\nAryaan returned to shore and gathered the diving group. He felt his chest rise and fall quickly as he spoke, words tumbling out with urgency.  \n\n[CHOICE POINT 2] How should Aryaan inspire others?  \nA) Show them his sketches of healthy vs. bleached coral  \nB) Invite them to dive and see for themselves  \nC) Share what he learned about climate change and coral  \n\n[CONSEQUENCE A] The sketches made people quiet. They could see the difference clearly.  \n[CONSEQUENCE B] The dive amazed his friends—once they saw the bleaching, they wanted to act.  \n[CONSEQUENCE C] His words connected the science to the beauty they loved. Heads nodded with determination.  \n\n[STORY CONTINUATION] Together, they created a plan: monitor the reef’s health, teach visitors, and protect the garden.  \n\n[FINAL CONCLUSION] Aryaan felt a wave of hope. Even small choices—like sharing knowledge—could ripple outward like ocean waves.  \n\n[ACTION REFLECTION] How could YOU share something important you’ve learned with others?",
    "challenge": "Aryaan dove deep, pressure tightening slightly in his ears, until the coral city appeared below him. The reef glowed with intricate textures—brain corals etched with grooves, delicate staghorns stretching upward, soft corals swaying like underwater forests. Crackles and pops filled the water, the living sound of shrimp and fish. He reached out, fingertips grazing the surface of a coral colony, feeling both its roughness and its warmth of life.\n\n[CHOICE POINT 1] Where should Aryaan begin his observations?  \nA) Study the coral polyps and their tiny algae partners  \nB) Record fish behavior in his underwater journal  \nC) Measure the water’s temperature near bleaching sites  \n\n[CONSEQUENCE A] Aryaan observed the polyps. Some looked healthy, but others had expelled their algae—turning ghostly white.  \n[CONSEQUENCE B] Aryaan noted fish patterns. In bleached areas, far fewer species gathered. The ecosystem balance was shifting.  \n[CONSEQUENCE C] Aryaan’s thermometer confirmed his fear—the water was warmer than usual.  \n\n[STORY CONTINUATION] Every sign pointed to climate stress. Ocean acidification and heat were unraveling the reef’s delicate web.  \n\n[PERSONAL REFLECTION] Have you ever noticed a chain reaction—where one small change made everything else feel different?  \n\nBack on land, Aryaan addressed marine scientists, his voice steady but urgent.  \n\n[CHOICE POINT 2] How should Aryaan take action?  \nA) Propose a community-led reef monitoring program  \nB) Launch school workshops about climate and coral  \nC) Partner with scientists to publish his findings  \n\n[CONSEQUENCE A] The community grew invested—divers began reporting bleaching events.  \n[CONSEQUENCE B] Students gasped in awe at reef photos, inspired to care for oceans.  \n[CONSEQUENCE C] His paper spread across research networks, strengthening global knowledge.  \n\n[STORY CONTINUATION] No matter the path, Aryaan sparked both awareness and scientific progress.  \n\n[FINAL CONCLUSION] The coral garden, fragile yet resilient, had found a new guardian in Aryaan—and in those who listened.  \n\n[ACTION REFLECTION] What’s one step YOU could take to protect an ecosystem you care about?"
