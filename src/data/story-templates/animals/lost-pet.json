      "simple": "Rishi found a sad dog walking around the park. The dog had a collar but no person with it. The dog looked hungry and tired. Rishi gave it some water and a snack. He read the name tag that said 'Buddy.' Rishi called the phone number on the tag. A worried family answered right away! They had been looking for Buddy all day. When they came to get him, everyone was crying happy tears. Buddy wagged his tail and licked everyone's face. Rishi felt amazing for helping reunite the family.",
      
      "regular": "Rishi encountered a disoriented golden retriever wandering aimlessly through the neighborhood park without any visible supervision. The distressed animal displayed obvious signs of exhaustion and dehydration from prolonged separation from its family. After providing fresh water and emergency nutrition, Rishi examined the dog's identification tags and contacted the registered owners immediately. The relieved family arrived within minutes, explaining that Buddy had escaped during a thunderstorm the previous evening. The emotional reunion highlighted the deep bonds between pets and their human families. Rishi experienced profound satisfaction knowing his quick thinking and compassionate action had prevented a potential tragedy.",
      
      "challenge": "Rishi discovered a severely disoriented canine companion exhibiting classic symptoms of separation anxiety and environmental displacement within the municipal recreational facility. The Golden Retriever demonstrated considerable psychological distress and physiological depletion consistent with extended periods of inadequate nutrition and hydration. Following proper animal handling protocols, Rishi administered immediate supportive care before accessing the pet's identification documentation and initiating contact with the registered guardians. The family's expeditious response revealed that their beloved companion had experienced acute storm-related trauma resulting in escape behavior during severe meteorological conditions. This successful pet recovery operation exemplified the critical importance of community vigilance and responsible animal welfare intervention in urban environments."
