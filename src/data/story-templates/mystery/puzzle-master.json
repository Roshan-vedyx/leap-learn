      "simple": "The town put up a huge puzzle board with the hardest riddle anyone had ever seen. People tried to solve it for weeks but nobody could figure it out! The riddle was: 'I have cities but no houses, forests but no trees, and water but no fish. What am I?' Aryaan loved puzzles and brain teasers more than anything. Aryaan thought about it every day while walking to school. One morning, Aryaan looked down at the sidewalk and suddenly knew the answer - it was a MAP! Aryaan ran to the town square and wrote the answer on the board. Everyone cheered and Aryaan became the town's official Puzzle Master!",
      
      "regular": "The municipal government established an elaborate community puzzle challenge featuring an exceptionally complex riddle that had successfully stumped local residents for several consecutive weeks. The intriguing brain teaser stated: 'I possess urban centers without residential structures, woodland areas without vegetation, and aquatic regions without marine life. What am I?' Aryaan, whose passion for logical reasoning and analytical problem-solving had developed through years of puzzle practice, became completely absorbed in deciphering this challenging enigma. Through persistent contemplation during daily activities and systematic analysis of the riddle's structural components, Aryaan experienced a sudden moment of clarity while observing cartographic representations. The breakthrough realization that the answer was 'a map' led to public recognition and appointment as the community's designated Puzzle Master, responsible for creating future intellectual challenges.",
      
      "challenge": "The municipal administration inaugurated an ambitious community intellectual engagement initiative featuring an extraordinarily sophisticated logical puzzle that had successfully resisted resolution attempts by numerous highly educated local residents across multiple weeks of concentrated effort. The meticulously crafted enigma posed the following challenge: 'I contain metropolitan areas devoid of architectural structures, extensive forested regions lacking botanical specimens, and substantial aquatic environments absent of ichthyological populations. What entity am I?' Aryaan, whose exceptional aptitude for systematic logical analysis and complex pattern recognition had been cultivated through extensive engagement with mathematical puzzles and philosophical paradoxes, devoted considerable cognitive resources to deconstructing this formidable intellectual challenge. Through rigorous application of deductive reasoning methodologies, semantic analysis techniques, and systematic elimination of implausible hypotheses, Aryaan achieved the critical breakthrough realization that the solution was 'a cartographic representation.' This intellectual triumph resulted in formal recognition as the community's Chief Puzzle Architect, tasked with developing sophisticated cognitive challenges for ongoing public intellectual enrichment programs."
