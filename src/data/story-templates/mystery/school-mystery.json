      "simple": "Strange good things kept happening around school and nobody knew why! Someone left encouraging notes in lockers, brought snacks for the teachers, and fixed broken things in classrooms. Piya decided to figure out who was doing all these nice acts. Piya watched carefully and noticed patterns about when and where the kind things happened. Piya saw janitor Mr. Garcia staying late and noticed his tool belt had colorful paper in it. Piya realized Mr. Garcia was the secret helper! When Piya asked him about it, Mr. Garcia smiled and said helping others made him happy. Piya promised to keep helping him spread kindness around school.",
      
      "regular": "A series of anonymous benevolent activities began occurring throughout the school, including motivational messages appearing in student lockers, surprise refreshments for faculty, and mysterious repairs of damaged classroom equipment. The consistent pattern of altruistic behavior puzzled students and staff while creating a remarkably positive institutional atmosphere. Intrigued by this mystery, Piya initiated a systematic investigation to identify the generous benefactor responsible for these morale-boosting interventions. Through careful observation and pattern analysis, Piya detected correlations between the timing of kind acts and custodial maintenance schedules. Further investigation revealed that Mr. Garcia, the dedicated building maintenance specialist, had been voluntarily performing these compassionate gestures during his personal time. When diplomatically questioned about his motivations, Mr. Garcia explained that contributing to student and faculty wellbeing provided him with profound personal satisfaction and sense of purpose.",
      
      "challenge": "An elaborate sequence of sophisticated philanthropic interventions began manifesting throughout the educational institution, encompassing personalized motivational correspondence, strategic nutritional provisions for faculty, and complex infrastructural repairs that significantly enhanced the overall institutional environment. These systematic altruistic activities demonstrated considerable planning, resource allocation, and intimate knowledge of individual student and faculty needs while maintaining complete operational anonymity. Recognizing the profound positive impact of these mysterious benefactor activities, Piya implemented comprehensive investigative protocols including temporal pattern analysis, spatial correlation studies, and behavioral observation methodologies. Through systematic elimination of potential suspects and careful analysis of operational logistics, Piya identified Mr. Garcia, the institutional facilities management specialist, as the sophisticated architect of this comprehensive compassion campaign. When respectfully approached regarding his clandestine charitable operations, Mr. Garcia articulated his philosophical commitment to creating supportive educational environments through anonymous service and his deep personal fulfillment derived from contributing to collective institutional wellbeing and student success."
