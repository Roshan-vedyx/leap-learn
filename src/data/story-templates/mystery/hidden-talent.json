      "simple": "Rishi noticed beautiful chalk drawings appearing around school every morning. The art showed amazing animals and flowers that made everyone smile. But nobody knew who was making them! Rishi decided to solve this happy mystery. Rishi came to school early and hid behind a tree to watch. Rishi saw a quiet student named Jordan making the gorgeous artwork before anyone else arrived. Jordan was shy and didn't want people to know.

Now Jordan's talent could shine with friends who understood.",
      
      "regular": "Rishi became intrigued by the mysterious appearance of exceptionally beautiful chalk murals that materialized throughout the school campus each morning, featuring intricate botanical designs and wildlife portraits that consistently amazed students and faculty. The anonymous artist demonstrated remarkable technical skill and creative vision, yet their identity remained completely unknown despite widespread curiosity and admiration. Determined to solve this delightful mystery, Rishi implemented careful surveillance strategies and arrived early to conduct covert observations.

Through respectful dialogue and genuine appreciation, Rishi helped Jordan recognize the value of their artistic contributions while connecting them with supportive creative communities.",
      
      "challenge": "Rishi became captivated by the systematic appearance of extraordinarily sophisticated chalk art installations that emerged throughout the educational facility each dawn, featuring meticulously detailed botanical illustrations and zoological portraits that demonstrated exceptional artistic proficiency and aesthetic sophistication. Despite widespread institutional admiration and curiosity regarding these anonymous creative contributions, the identity of this remarkably talented individual remained completely enigmatic. Implementing systematic investigative methodologies including temporal pattern analysis and strategic observational positioning, Rishi conducted comprehensive surveillance operations to identify the mysterious benefactor. The revelation uncovered Jordan's exceptional artistic capabilities, which they had concealed due to social anxiety disorders and perfectionist tendencies that inhibited public creative expression. Through empathetic intervention and authentic appreciation of Jordan's remarkable talents, Rishi facilitated meaningful connections with supportive artistic communities while respecting their psychological comfort zones and individual creative autonomy."
