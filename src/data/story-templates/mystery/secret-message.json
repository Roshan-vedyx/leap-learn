  "simple": "Maya found this totally weird note in her locker with strange symbols instead of regular letters. The message looked like: ★♦▲●◆★♦. Maya was super curious about what it could possibly mean! [CHOICE POINT 1] How should Maya crack this mysterious code? A) Show it to Sam who loves puzzles and brain teasers, B) Try to figure out patterns by counting and comparing symbols, or C) Research different types of secret codes online. [CONSEQUENCE 1A] Sam got really excited and noticed that each symbol appeared exactly the same number of times as letters in Maya's name - that was the first big clue! [CONSEQUENCE 1B] Carefully counting symbols revealed patterns that helped Maya realize each symbol probably stood for a different letter. [CONSEQUENCE 1C] Learning about substitution ciphers online gave Maya the strategy to crack the code systematically. Working together, they figured out each symbol matched a letter, and when decoded the message said 'MEET ME AT THE OLD OAK TREE.' [CHOICE POINT 2] Should Maya and Sam follow this mysterious invitation? A) Go to the oak tree right away to see what happens, B) Bring other trusted friends for safety and support, or C) Plan to meet during school hours when it's safer. [CONSEQUENCE 2A/2B/2C] At the old oak tree, they discovered another student who wanted to start an awesome secret puzzle club for kids who love codes and brain teasers. The mysterious note had been a clever invitation and membership test rolled into one! [PERSONAL REFLECTION] Have you ever received a message or invitation that felt mysterious or exciting? How did it make you feel? [ACTION REFLECTION] What kind of secret club or special group would you want to create or join?",
    "regular": "Maya discovered a completely puzzling encrypted message hidden in her school locker - instead of normal letters, it contained a sequence of geometric symbols that looked like some kind of secret code. The cryptographic challenge immediately sparked her analytical curiosity and desire to solve this intriguing mystery. [CHOICE POINT 1] This code-breaking mission would require some strategic thinking approaches. A) Collaborate with Sam, whose pattern recognition skills could provide crucial insights for decryption, B) Apply systematic frequency analysis and symbol-counting techniques to identify underlying patterns, or C) Research historical cryptography methods and cipher-solving strategies for guidance. [CONSEQUENCE 1A] Partnering with Sam revealed breakthrough insights when they noticed the symbol distribution perfectly matched common English letter frequency patterns, providing the key to unlocking the cipher. [CONSEQUENCE 1B] Methodical symbol analysis and pattern recognition work gradually revealed the substitution logic underlying the encrypted message structure. [CONSEQUENCE 1C] Studying classical cryptography techniques equipped Maya with systematic approaches for tackling substitution ciphers and symbolic encryption methods. Through collaborative analytical work, they successfully decoded the mysterious message to reveal an invitation: 'MEET ME AT THE OLD OAK TREE.' [CHOICE POINT 2] Having cracked the code, what's the wisest approach to following this intriguing invitation? A) Head directly to the designated meeting location to discover who sent the mysterious message, B) Recruit additional trusted friends to join the meeting for mutual support and safety, or C) Schedule the meeting during school hours to ensure a secure and supervised environment. [CONSEQUENCE 2A/2B/2C] The oak tree meeting revealed an enthusiastic student who had designed this recruitment challenge to identify others passionate about puzzle-solving and cryptography for a new intellectual club. The encrypted message had served as both invitation and qualification test for potential members. [PERSONAL REFLECTION] What draws you to solving puzzles and codes, and how does it feel to successfully crack something that initially seemed impossible? [ACTION REFLECTION] How could you design creative challenges or invitations that would help you connect with others who share your interests?",
    
    "challenge": "Maya discovered an incredibly sophisticated encrypted communication tucked inside her locker - a complex symbolic substitution cipher that looked like serious spy-level cryptography. This wasn't some basic puzzle; whoever created this code knew advanced encryption techniques and was clearly testing for people with serious analytical skills. [CHOICE POINT 1] Cracking this level of encryption would require some next-level codebreaking strategies. A) Team up with Sam whose computational thinking and pattern recognition abilities could provide essential collaborative brainpower for tackling complex cryptographic challenges, B) Apply advanced frequency analysis techniques, statistical distribution studies, and systematic symbol-pattern mapping to deconstruct the cipher methodology, or C) Deep-dive into research about historical cryptography, wartime encryption methods, and professional codebreaking techniques to understand sophisticated cipher construction. [CONSEQUENCE 1A] Collaborative analysis with Sam revealed that the cipher used advanced substitution algorithms based on mathematical relationships between symbol frequency and standard English letter distributions - brilliant stuff! [CONSEQUENCE 1B] Intensive statistical analysis and systematic pattern recognition work gradually exposed the underlying encryption logic and mathematical relationships governing the symbol substitutions. [CONSEQUENCE 1C] Extensive cryptography research provided crucial background knowledge about cipher theory, encryption methodologies, and professional codebreaking approaches that proved essential for solving this complex puzzle. After serious analytical work, they finally cracked the code to reveal an invitation: 'MEET ME AT THE OLD OAK TREE.' [CHOICE POINT 2] Having conquered this seriously challenging encryption, what's the smartest way to respond to this mysterious invitation? A) Head straight to the meeting location to discover who has this level of cryptographic knowledge and what they want, B) Bring along other intellectually curious friends who could appreciate both the code-solving achievement and whatever opportunity this represents, or C) Plan the meeting strategically during school hours to maintain safety while satisfying curiosity about this intriguing connection. [CONSEQUENCE 2A/2B/2C] The oak tree encounter revealed a fellow student with genuine expertise in cryptography who had designed this elaborate recruitment test to find others capable of advanced puzzle-solving for an underground academic enrichment society. The encrypted message had been both invitation and intellectual qualification exam rolled into one brilliant challenge. [PERSONAL REFLECTION] What drives your fascination with complex problems that most people would find overwhelming, and how does successfully solving difficult challenges affect your confidence? [ACTION REFLECTION] How could you create intellectual challenges or opportunities that would help you connect with others who share your passion for advanced problem-solving and analytical thinking?"
